                    People tend to look outward into space and wonder about all the possibilities of life out there. Are there bacteria
                    frozen in the polar ice caps of Mars? Are there small animal-like creatures deep in the oceans of a planet just outside
                    our solar system? Are there ancient ruins of another civilization just outside our galaxy? What if I were to tell you
                    that if life was ever discovered, especially sentient lifeforms, that it would be terrible news. But how could the most
                    exciting discovery of our lives be dire?
                </p>
                <p>
                    To understand this, you must first take a step back and think of the development of life as a staircase from the first
                    atoms floating around space to humans as we know them today. The first step on this staircase would be the creation of
                    DNA, able to mutate and evolve. The second step on this staircase would be early unicellular life to begin to grow more
                    complex, with the third step being the joining of these unicellular organisms into multicellular beings known as plants
                    and animals. The fourth step is the development of intelligent life, with capabilities such as tool use, culture, and
                    shared knowledge through language. This leads the species to be the dominant life form on the planet — humans, allowing
                    us to shape the world to our needs, and solidifying us as the most prominent species on the planet.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The following steps on the staircase are ones that we haven’t taken yet, although we are in the process of climbing the
                    next step, and that is small attempts to explore the area surrounding our world, and eventually be able to leave it when
                    the need arises. This imaginary staircase is what is known as the Fermi Paradox, and it was first theorized in 1996.
                    Here we are 24 years later, and the same problems are still being discussed. In intelligent life, as we know it, our
                    nature dictates that we reach out and attempt to inhabit all possible niches that can support us. The main problem with
                    that is that every planet has both a carrying capacity and a lifespan — giving the human race cause to look outwards
                    beyond our planet for an eventual place to colonize.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After this step that we are on now, of learning how to navigate space travel, the remaining three steps would be to
                    colonize one’s solar system, then the neighboring solar systems, then eventually the entire galaxy. This staircase
                    appears to be the universal principle for intelligent life to follow no matter where they are from, because if a species
                    is driven and competitive enough to take over an entire planet, it almost certainly wouldn’t stop there. There are at
                    least 500 billion planets in the Milky Way Galaxy, including at least 10 billion planets with earth-like conditions,
                    which have been around for billions of years longer than the earth has. According to the Drake equation, the galaxy is
                    too vast for life to not exist outside of earth, so why are we observing zero galactic civilizations?
                </p>
                <p>
                    This empty dead space without any semblance of life means that something is preventing intelligent life from climbing to
                    the top of this metaphorical staircase past the step that we have reached as human civilization. This theory is what is
                    known as The Great Filter. The Great Filter is a barrier so difficult to overcome that it eliminates nearly every
                    species that encounters it, which means one of two things — humans are incredibly special and lucky as a species to have
                    already passed this barrier, or we are doomed because we haven’t yet reached this impenetrable barrier. The Great Filter
                    is either behind us in the evolutionary staircase, or ahead of us.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the first scenario, the filter is behind us, and humans are the first who have reached this level of planet
                    dominating intelligence. If this is the case, then one of the previous steps was nearly impossible to take, whether it
                    be the formation of unicellular organisms or the development of intelligent life, we may never know.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Despite not knowing, we can hypothesize as to what it might be, in the hope that we can rationalize that the filter must
                    be behind us. Maybe it’s on the first step, and the development of life of any kind is nearly impossible, or maybe it’s
                    on the third step, because the odds of a unicellular organism joining with another is so rare, or perhaps it’s in the
                    development of intelligent life step, because despite the benefits of having a higher intelligence, it requires much
                    more food intake to maintain, and doesn’t provide any benefits when dealing with predators. This could be why it has
                    taken humans nearly 200,000 years to get to the level of intelligence that we are at today.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the second scenario, the filter is ahead of us and we are doomed as a species. This must mean that the filter is more
                    dangerous than anything ever encountered before in the world, because even if a disaster struck and wiped out the
                    majority of the population, or sent us back technologically thousands of years, we would survive and recover and
                    eventually reach this point again, making the event more of a hurdle than a Great Filter. A chilling hypothesis is that
                    after a species takes entire control over its planet, it is already on the path to self-destruction, and nothing can
                    change that.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So what could The Great Filter possibly be if we are yet to reach it? It needs to be something so essential to space
                    travel that every intelligent species must discover it, so the answer is simple — it’s technology. Whether it’s nuclear
                    annihilation, rampant nanotechnology, engineered super-viruses, extreme atmosphere damage to the point of planetary
                    collapse, or something we can’t even begin to predict right now, it must be tied to technology.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So this is why finding alien life would be disastrous. The more advanced and abundant life we find in the universe, the
                    more likely it is that The Great Filter is ahead of us like in scenario 2. Finding bacteria would be awful, but finding
                    multicellular intelligent life would be worse, and finding ruins of ancient alien civilizations would be downright
                    catastrophic. This means that despite what many people wish to believe when looking out into the vast emptiness of
                    space, our best-case scenario is that it is exactly that — empty. That The Great Filter is behind us and we genuinely
                    are the first species to get this far, and there are billions of empty planets just waiting for us to travel to and call
                    home.
