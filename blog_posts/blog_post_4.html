                <p>
                    In November 2015, the U.S. House of Representatives held a hearing about draft guidance from the U.S. Food and Drug
                    Administration (FDA) about closing a regulatory loophole exploited by Theranos. However, the draft guidance was never
                    put into law, with one congressman objecting, “Why in the world would a lab develop a test that wasn’t safe and
                    accurate?” The short answer: because its founder wanted to become the world’s youngest self-made female billionaire.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We’ve seen the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) flounder as it scrambled to develop a test for
                    SARS-CoV-2, heard President Trump blame Obama-era regulations for the lack of tests, and are now hearing about serology
                    tests that can determine if we can go back to work. Because of my role in exposing the Theranos scandal and starting a
                    diagnostic company of my own, I have been asked countless times: “What is going on with coronavirus testing?” While
                    there is certainly value in moving as fast as possible during this crisis, I am worried that we are creating an
                    environment that facilitates many of the same mistakes Theranos made.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Theranos spent 15 years and nearly a billion dollars of venture capital and only got FDA clearance for one test — oral
                    herpes, which is more commonly diagnosed by simple visual inspection than with a blood test. How can so many years and
                    dollars result in such astonishing failure? Sure, bad scientific methods, poor engineering, terrible management,
                    uninformed investors, a negligent board, and fraud played a part. But from my perspective, our worst and most pervasive
                    sin was a simple one: cutting corners. We “launched” a product that claimed to perform hundreds of tests from a single
                    drop of blood when in reality we could only do one. We needed to launch more tests, we needed to test more patients, and
                    we needed to do so quickly. If there was a corner that could be cut, it was gone.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The deadline to get SARS-CoV-2 tests working and distributed was not artificial — Covid-19 was coming, whether we were
                    prepared for it or not. And just like at Theranos, sweet talking, half-truths, and unfounded optimism were not going to
                    help. The CDC rushed to develop and distribute a test, and the first tests were sent out on February 5, just weeks after
                    development began. However, many labs found that the negative controls from the test kits produced positive results.
                    This was a clear sign that the tests were not working. By the end of February, the CDC said it had only tested 1,235
                    people for SARS-CoV-2. For reference, South Korea had tested over 100,000 people by that time. On February 29, the FDA
                    released a policy to guide the private sector in the development of tests for SARS-CoV-2.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The policy itself includes validation requirements that must be met in order to market a test using the FDA’s Emergency
                    Use Authorization for SARS-CoV-2. To me, the validation requirements are remarkably relaxed. Under the section “Clinical
                    Evaluation,” the “FDA recommends that laboratories confirm performance of their assay… by testing a minimum of 30
                    contrived reactive specimens.” Rather than test samples from patients who actually have Covid-19, labs can take 30
                    healthy samples, add SARS-CoV-2, and test those. This allows labs to start testing patients without ever validating that
                    their test works in real-world circumstances.
                </p>
                <h3>Covid-19 PCR tests are far from perfect</h3>
                <p>
                    While the PCR tests used to detect active SARS-CoV-2 are capable of detecting a very small amount of the virus, the real
                    world sensitivity of these tests has shown to be surprisingly low. A letter published in the Journal of the American
                    Medical Association on March 11 evaluated the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in various sample specimens. It found that the
                    sensitivity for the most commonly used sample, a pharyngeal swab, for Covid-19 testing was only 32%. This means that if
                    100 people infected with the virus got tested, the test would tell 68 people that they did not have the virus. Sputum,
                    another type of sample, performed much better at 75% sensitivity. Another study published in Radiology found the
                    sensitivity of throat swabs to be 71%. We still don’t know exactly how well these Covid-19 tests work, but it’s clear
                    they are far from perfect and a negative Covid-19 test does not rule out that someone is infected with SARS-CoV-2. This
                    is why it’s standard practice to require two consecutive negative tests in order to be released from quarantine after
                    known exposure to Covid-19. Furthermore, when doctors evaluate patients, they do not rely solely on these SARS-CoV-2 PCR
                    tests, but also evaluate symptoms and exclude diseases that present similarly like influenza and pneumonia.
                </p>
                <h3>Serology testing</h3>
                <p>
                    Now that we are beginning to reopen the economy, a different type of test has been making headlines: serology, or
                    antibody tests. The Covid-19 serology tests measure IgG and IgM antibodies, which are indicators of the body’s immune
                    response to SARS-CoV-2. Having these antibodies means that you have been exposed to the virus, and theoretically may
                    have some immunity against future infections. While that sounds like an awesome test to determine who can safely return
                    to work, the WHO issued a statement on April 24 saying, “There is currently no evidence that people who have recovered
                    from Covid-19 and have antibodies are protected from a second infection.” However, don’t hear what the WHO is not
                    saying. They are not definitively saying “serologic tests do not show that an individual has immunity,” rather they are
                    cautioning that there is a lack of clinical evidence to validate the idea. SARS-CoV (more commonly referred to simply as
                    “SARS”) is the virus most similar to SARS-CoV-2 that causes infection in humans. After a SARS infection, humans maintain
                    strong antibody titers against the virus for two years, and are believed to be susceptible to reinfection after about
                    three years. While this gives us reason to be optimistic about immunity conveyed from a SARS-CoV-2 infection, it should
                    also be noted that SARS and SARS-CoV-2 are only 79% genetically similar. For reference, humans share about 96% of their
                    genome with chimpanzees, so nature has a way of making dramatic changes with relatively small modifications to genetics.
                    While I am cautiously optimistic about the promise of serology tests, in order to make the best use of these tests there
                    are a few fundamental questions we need to answer:
                </p>
                <p>
                    1. Does having antibodies convey immunity?
                </p>
                <p>
                    2. What concentration of antibodies is required to maintain immunity?
                </p>
                <p>
                    3. How long does immunity typically last?
                </p>
                <p>
                    4. Does immunity to one strain of SARS-CoV-2 give you immunity to all strains?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Despite not having answers to these questions, serology tests will likely play a role in bringing our workforce back to
                    work. As part of the FDA policy on Covid-19 test development, they specifically include a section about validation of
                    serology tests. At just 78 words, the guidelines are even more sparse than those for the PCR tests discussed earlier.
                    Unlike the guidance for PCR tests, it does not have specific recommendations on how many samples to test or what type of
                    performance characteristics must be met. It is clear that the FDA is allowing companies to develop and market these
                    tests as quickly as possible, and largely trusting those companies to hold themselves to a high standard. As speed is
                    critical, this is not necessarily a bad thing, but it nonetheless leaves me feeling uneasy. Like we learned with the
                    tests from the CDC, it doesn’t matter how quickly you develop a test if the test doesn’t work.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A lack of regulatory oversight was Theranos’ bread and butter, and they would have thrived in this environment. I’m sure
                    many people are thinking similarly to the congressman who argued against closing the regulatory loophole Theranos
                    exploited: “Why in the world would a lab develop a test that wasn’t safe and accurate?” Because it is an enormous
                    market, and it will be impossible for consumers to distinguish accurate tests from inaccurate ones. The stimulus package
                    passed by Congress set aside $25 billion for Covid-19 testing; there are companies that won’t think twice about risking
                    your health for a slice of that pie. The FDA published their guidelines on February 29, and less than a month later,
                    over 100 companies had notified the FDA that they had serology tests ready for use. The FDA also noted that “some firms
                    are falsely claiming that their serological tests are FDA approved or authorized, or falsely claiming that they can
                    diagnose Covid-19. The FDA will take appropriate action against firms making false claims or marketing tests that are
                    not accurate and reliable.” The FDA and NIH have now developed a public-private partnership program to validate tests in
                    conjunction with corporations who wish to go above and beyond what is legally required of them.
                </p>
                <h3>Seroprevalence studies</h3>
                <p>
                    While it is yet to be confirmed that having antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 prevents reinfection from the virus, serology
                    tests are useful for epidemiological studies to see where the virus has been and how it has affected those communities.
                    A seroprevalence study conducted by Stanford published on April 11 estimated the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in Santa Clara
                    County to be about 50 to 85 times higher than the number of confirmed cases, with about 2.8% of the population having
                    antibodies against the virus. The paper does not calculate a fatality rate from its findings, but in an interview the
                    principal investigator says the data “suggest that the infection fatality rate for this new coronavirus is likely to be
                    in the same ballpark as seasonal influenza.” While it is fantastic news that the virus is not as lethal as we thought, a
                    quick back-of-the-envelope calculation shows that something doesn’t add up. The fatality rate for seasonal influenza is
                    0.1%. As of May 1, there have been 13,000 deaths in New York City from coronavirus. Therefore, 13 million people would
                    need to have been infected in a city that only has a population of 8 million people. A different serology study found
                    that 21% of New Yorkers had been exposed to the virus. Another back-of-the-envelope calculation (12,976/(8,399,000*21%)
                    = 0.74%) suggests that the fatality rate in New York City is about seven times higher than the seasonal flu, which is
                    still significantly lower than we originally thought for Covid-19. However, the difference in results between these
                    studies suggests that either the tools used in these studies are not reliable, or we are missing a big piece of this
                    puzzle.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Both of these serology studies, but particularly the Stanford one, have been attacked for their study methodologies. The
                    Stanford study validated the specificity of its test on 30 negative samples, which were all correctly diagnosed as
                    negative. The calculations made in the paper then assumed that all 50 of the positive results found in the 3,300 people
                    tested were true positives. Assuming 100% specificity based on 30 negative samples did not seem sufficient to
                    statisticians; the director of the applied statistics center at Columbia University said the authors of the study “owe
                    us all an apology.” According to the manufacturer, whose data was not reviewed by the FDA, the specificity of the test
                    used in the Stanford serology study is 99.5%. While that may not sound like a big difference from 100%, it would predict
                    about 18 people in the study to have falsely produced positive results. That makes a big difference when the author
                    makes statements about Covid-19 being no worse than the seasonal flu based on 50 positive results out of 3,300 tested.
                </p>
                <h3>Comparing Covid-19 to influenza</h3>
                <p>
                    I generally dislike comparisons of Covid-19 to influenza because it is an equivalence that lures people into a false
                    sense of security — the flu is something they’ve experienced and can understand. It’s like comparing a wolf to a
                    Siberian Husky: both have sharp teeth, both eat meat, both have paws, fur, pointed ears, and love to chase things, but
                    one has been tamed and domesticated over many years while the other is wildly unpredictable. The reason we think the flu
                    is not that big of a deal is because it has been studied for hundreds of years and we have developed vaccines, herd
                    immunity, and effective treatments for it. Flu also migrates between hemispheres and never goes away to restart from
                    zero every year. A matter of months ago there was literally just one human in the entire world infected with SARS-CoV-2,
                    and look how far it has spread and how much damage it has caused in that short period of time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A better measure to compare flu to Covid-19 is to look at mortality, which is the rate at which people die from the
                    virus in the general population, as opposed to the fatality rate, which is the rate at which infected people die. This
                    metric takes into account how vaccinations, herd immunity, infection rate, and reproduction rate have affected the
                    spread of the virus and ultimately its death rate. For instance, the fatality rate of measles may be as high as 25%. But
                    are you more likely to die from measles than from flu or Covid-19? No, because the mortality rate of measles in the U.S.
                    is 0.00003% (2017) since most people are vaccinated for it. The CDC reports that the mortality rate of seasonal
                    influenza is 0.002%, while the mortality rate in New York City for COVID-19 is expected to hit 0.2%, killing one in 500
                    New Yorkers. The Covid-19 mortality rate in New York City is 100 times greater than the mortality rate of the flu
                    despite strict social distancing practices being enforced for over a month. The Lombardy region of Italy was slow to
                    adopt social distancing protocols and saw mortality rates 68 times greater than the flu. Sweden, where there is no
                    mandated lockdown, currently has a mortality rate 13 times higher than the flu, while its neighbor, Norway, has a
                    mortality rate about two times higher than the flu. Covid-19 is not the flu, and we’ll be better off if we didn’t
                    pretend that it was.
                </p>
                <h3>Moving forward</h3>
                <p>
                    As much as we want the decision of how to reopen the economy to be a data driven one, it’s not going to be. People are
                    hurting too much to not act emotionally. We’ve lost lives, we’ve lost jobs, and we’ve lost freedom and independence. To
                    make matters worse, each side of the debate will have scientific research to support its position. There are already
                    cases of mayors disagreeing with governors, disagreeing with the federal government. This will only intensify as the
                    damage from the virus continues to take its toll on the economy and our health. From the perspective of preventing the
                    spread of Covid-19, it would be great if we could all stay in our homes for the next two years while we wait for a
                    vaccine. But people are going to leave their homes, so we need to make sure we have tools and protections in place so
                    that we can do so as responsibly as possible. Those protections must include having affordable, widely available tests
                    that we can trust.

                    Eventually CMS, the FDA, the SEC, and the DOJ all took action against Theranos, which voided two years’ worth of blood
                    test results. In today’s world, inaccurate Covid-19 tests could embolden people to leave their homes when they are
                    infectious or to behave as if they are immune when they are not. The FDA is doing its best to strike the right balance
                    between speed and safety, but thus far we as a nation have been too slow to be effective while cutting too many corners
                    to be reliable. Now more than ever we need the public to put its trust in science, so I hope the diagnostic community
                    can rise to the occasion as health care professionals and frontline workers have during this pandemic.
